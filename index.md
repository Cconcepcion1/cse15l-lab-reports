**Lab Report 1

To Get Started: 
Step 1: Download and Install VSCode [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Versions for both Mac and Windows
after you have installed it you should see the application open like this ![Image](vscode.jpg)
I have VSCode already installed from past classes so there were not any steps included here.

Step 2: 
Windows Users: - install git for windows [Here](https://gitforwindows.org/)
Windows Users: - use default terminal to use git bash in VSCode [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994)

Mac Users: - use ssh by opening the terminal on VSCode then inputing: $ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu (the zz is replaced with course specific account letters.
Mac Users: - you will be asked to authenticate; type yes. 
Mac Users: - you will enter the password created specific to your course specific account letters. 
Mac Users: - you are now connected to your course account. 
Result of server should look like this ![Image](server.jpg)

I opened VSCode and inputted the command for my course account. 
Though the ports at the basement could not connect at the time i ended up using my account and not my cse acc. 
cconcepcion@ieng6ucsd.edu was used instead of my acc Cs15lsp23hp.


Step 3: 
Run commands such as cd , ls , pwd , mkdir , and cp and observe the commands you see in the terminal. 
Output picture shoud look like this ![Image](commands.jpg) 
Log out of the remote server by Ctrl+D or running the exit command.

Using my acc instead of my cse acc i went ahead and ran commands and observed their output. 
I was able to see the directory of my acc also the pathname and list of contents. 
Using the list command ls, i am able to access the contents in the directory currently in. 
At the end i went ahead and logged out of the remote server by Ctrl+D.
